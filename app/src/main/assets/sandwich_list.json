      "description": "Bagel toast (Hebrew: בייגל טוסט‎, romanized: Beygel Tost) is a sandwich commonly eaten in Israel. It is composed of a pressed, toasted bagel filled with vegetables and cheese and is grilled on a sandwich toaster or panini press. While the bagel is round with a hole in the center, it is unlike the typical American bagel in that it is made from a different dough[citation needed] with sesame seeds. Bagel toast is generally filled with tzfatit, feta, white, or yellow cheese, green olives, corn, tomatoes, onions, dressing, and pizza or chili sauce.",
